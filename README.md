# Skeleton-Superform

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

This is a combination of [Skeleton-UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/) and [SuperForms](https://superforms.vercel.app/) to create a basic notes app using Skeleton as the UI and Superforms for validate the created note


Inspired by https://github.com/huntabyte/noted-skeletonui
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
